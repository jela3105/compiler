## General description <a name="reserved-words"></a>
This programming language is pretty similar to C language. It just allows basic operations and boolean comparisons.

## Reserved words<a name="reserved-words"></a>
The following words are the reserved words for the language (all in lower case):
- ```if else int while```

## Special symbols <a name="special-symbols"></a>
This are the special symbols:
- ```+ - * / < <= > >= == != = ; ( ) [ ] { } ``` 

## Comments  <a name="comments"></a>
It's is important to say that is allow to write comments whenever there can be a white space. The comments can't be nested.
- `//`: The rest of the line is a comment and is ignored by the compiler
- `/*`: Start a large comment. 
- `*/`: Finish the large comment.
The large comments can be of many lines as needed.

 ## White spaces  <a name="white-spaces"></a>
 The white space is generally ignored, but not when it pretends to separate an ID, NUM or a reserved word.

 ## Examples  <a name="examples"></a>
